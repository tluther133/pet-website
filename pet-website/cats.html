  <h1>About Cats</h1>
  <p>Cats, though mostly self-sufficient, won't require as much of your attention as possible.</p>
  <h2>Feeding</h2>
  <p>Cats are hunters, so most of the time, they will hunt rodents for themselves. But, to earn it's trust, give it some meat. Remember, mature cats are lactose intolerant!</p>
  <h2>Grooming</h2>
  <p>Cats generally groom themselves, so this should not worry you much. Just take it to the vet occasionally.</p>
  <h2>Housing</h2>
  <p>Cats are clean creatures, so their environment isn't. Always clean their homes, and their feeding plates to prevent them from leaving.</p>
