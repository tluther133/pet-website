  <h1>About Dogs</h1>
  <p>Dogs give you attention, provided you give them something to eat and drink!:</p>
  <h2>Feeding</h2>
  <p>Dogs are carnivorous, so give them enough quantites of meat, ensure it is properly washed.</p>
  <h3>Grooming</h3>
  <p>Give your dogs a bath daily, trim their nails and give them a shave. Remember to take them to the vet occasionally.</p>
  <h4>Housing</h4>
  <p>Dogs need a place to sleep, if having a doghouse is too much. Ensure it is clean at all times, and is properly trained.</p>
